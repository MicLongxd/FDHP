# Training
### EPIC-Kitchens
- For rgb feature: python main.py --gpu_id 0 --batch_size 128 --mode train --modality rgb --hidden 1024 --feat_in 1024 --lr 0.05 --wd 1e-5 --reinforce_verb_weight 0 --reinforce_noun_weight 0  --revision_sd_weight 0 --revision_ad_weight 3 --revision_etp_weight 1.5 --revision_threshold 0.003 --epoch 300
Silimar commonds can be used for flow or obj features.
- For three modality features: python main.py --gpu_id 0 --batch_size 128 --mode train --modality fusion --lr 0.05 --wd 1e-5 --reinforce_verb_weight 0 --reinforce_noun_weight 0  --revision_sd_weight 0 --revision_ad_weight 0 --revision_etp_weight 0 --epoch 200
# Validation
###  Validation for Epic-Kitchen dataset
Please download the pre-trained model weigths from Baidu passward: 'wub3' or Google Drive, and put them in the folder './results/EPIC/base_srl/pre_trained/'.

 - For rgb feature: python main.py --gpu_ids 0 --batch_size 128 --mode validate --modality rgb --hidden 1024 --feat_in 1024 --best_model_name R4.06.18 --resume_timestamp pre_trained
 - For three modality features, python main.py --gpu_ids 0 --batch_size 128 --mode validate --modality fusion --best_model_name model_name
